1. Contextual Background: Provide some historical or contextual background if the pull request relates to a long-standing issue or is part of a larger feature set. This helps reviewers understand where this piece fits in the larger puzzle.

2. Visual Evidence: For UI changes, include screenshots or video links. Visual evidence can quickly convey the impact of changes and assist reviewers who might not be able to run the code immediately.

3. Performance Impact: If applicable, mention any performance implications. For instance, if the pull request improves or degrades performance, providing benchmarks or profiling data can be very helpful.

4. Dependencies and Integration: Specify if the pull request adds new dependencies or requires changes in other parts of the system. This is crucial for understanding the broader impact of the change.

5. Backward Compatibility and Migration Path: If the pull request introduces breaking changes, describe the migration path for existing codebases. This includes detailing any deprecations and the steps for users to adapt to the changes.

6. Risks and Mitigations: Discuss any potential risks associated with the pull request and the steps taken to mitigate them. This includes security considerations, potential regressions, or impacts on stability.

7. Acknowledgment of Collaborators: If the pull request was developed in collaboration with others or based on community contributions, acknowledging these contributors fosters a positive community spirit.

8. Reference to Coding Standards: If applicable, reference specific coding standards or guidelines followed, especially if the project adheres to particular coding styles or best practices."

For example, you are doing a PR to Cypress to include a new feature or to improve an existing API. Linking to a similar pattern in Plawright may be useful."

For example in the Flutter repo, they require unit tests that test the change you are making to be included with the PR. This is often overlooked by contributors that just want to fix their issue.

Also for UI related changes it is very helpful to have before and after screen shots in the description of the PR so that reviewers and the community can quickly see what you are fixing/changing.

Some PR may need a release note and some may not.

priority is important for reviewers as reviewers/maintainers's time is quite expensive. 

For contributing process, `action required` for upgrade and `behavior change` are quite important than other thing. Especially on API-Change, in some design principles, we should upgrade the version from 1.0 to 2.0 if we changes the spec. "
